# myDimos - Software Engineering Project
University project at Software Engineering class (ECE-AUTH- 8th Semester).  
## Introduction 
The project is about a concept web application to be develop and consists of 2 deliverables. Each team has to chose a web aplication and has to specify the user's and system's requirments, write the REST-API specifications for the system and implement the system's flows on NodeRED. Me and my Team chose a web application that simplifies the procedure of reporting municipalityâ€™s issues, by residents!
